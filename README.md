## About

Main goal of the website was to create a single page application using Django as backend to keep track of the likes and views a quote. Using [htmx](https://htmx.org) I was able to make the site interactive with little to no JavaScript used. [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) helped me quickly set up the site's structure.
